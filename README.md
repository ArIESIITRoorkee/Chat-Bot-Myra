# Chat-Bot-Myra

"Myra" is the name of our Chat Bot

train.py --> contains the code for training the model

myra.py --> contains the code for predicting the answers

Myra uses Naive Bayes classifier to predict answers using NLP .

data5.csv --> contains the question-answer set.
You can put up to 200 different classes (5 different questions for each class)
Note : It is recommended you create the data5.csv in ubuntu and use(in windows you may face some problem, rest of the project will work fine in windows)

resmap.py --> contains the answers to the questions mentioned in data5.csv
You can append the answers to this file in the same order as in the data5.csv file

Note : You can train Myra to be used for some specific purposes like queries related to Railway bookings etc. The program is not hard-coded but the domain of answers is limited.

Cheers! Your Chatbot is ready
